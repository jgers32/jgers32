### Hi there, my name is Julia Gersey. I am a junior at <a href="https://www.bw.edu/">Baldwin Wallace University</a> working towards my BSc in both Computer Science & Applied Mathematics!

Some other things about me: 

- My research focuses on <a href="https://mopsdev.bw.edu/~bkrupp/aq/view.php">air quality</a>, and I am a <a href="http://osgc.org/recipients/">NASA OSGC scholar</a> for the 2022-2023 school year. 

- I am currently looking for PhD programs that start in Fall of 2024. My research interests lie in ubiquitous computing and human-computer interaction. I am interested in embedding sensors and computers in the physical world while focusing on designing these systems to be human-centered.
