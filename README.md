### Hi! My name is Julia Gersey & I am a Senior at <a href="https://www.bw.edu/">Baldwin Wallace University</a> working towards my BSc in both Computer Science & Applied Mathematics. Check out my <a href="https://juliagersey.com">website</a> for more info.

Some other things about me: 

- My research focuses on <a href="https://mopsdev.bw.edu/air">air quality</a>, and I am a <a href="http://osgc.org/recipients/">NASA OSGC scholar</a> for the 2023-2024 school year.
