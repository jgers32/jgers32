### Hi there 👋  my name is Julia Gersey. I am a sophomore at <a href="https://www.bw.edu/">Baldwin Wallace University</a>👩🏻‍🎓 working towards my BSc in both Software Engineering & Applied Mathematics!

Some other things about me: 

- 💻 I’m currently wrapping up my summer classes, packing to move back to school, and interning as a web app development intern @ <a href="https://www.goqwickly.com/">Qwickly</a>!

- 📚 My most used language at the moment is Swift, as I grow into being an iOS Developer for BW's <a href="https://p3.scgcorp.com/projects/smartphones-reduce-food-waste-and-insecurity">Campus Plate</a> application, but otherwise I prefer Python, Java or Javascript.  

- 👩🏻‍💻 I'm currently working on rebuilding my <a href="https://juliagersey.xyz">personal website</a> into a Django web app, so I can better organize it and more easily keep it up to date.

- 💬 Connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliagersey/">LinkedIn</a>!
